# Interpretability-Techniques

Machine learning has significantly advanced data science by helping to achieve superior model performance. However, it comes at the cost of complexity and interpretability. Therefore, interpretability techniques are required to offset this increase in complexity. In this project, we analyze five interpretability techniques and assessing their respective advantages and disadvantages. These techniques include feature importance plots, partial dependence plots, individual conditional expectations, global/local surrogate, and Shapley value.
